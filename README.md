# Titanic Survival Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Overview
This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns that influenced passenger survival.  
It demonstrates real-world **data analysis, visualization, and preprocessing** skills — key components of an AI/ML workflow.

The notebook walks through cleaning the dataset, understanding feature relationships, and visualizing trends that can inform future predictive modeling.

## Project Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.  
- Identify and visualize relationships between features such as age, gender, class, and survival.  
- Handle missing values and outliers effectively.  
- Generate insights that guide **feature engineering** for model development.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading & Overview** – Inspect data structure, size, and types.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values and inconsistent entries.  
3. **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis** – Explore each feature’s distribution and its impact on survival.  
4. **Visualization** – Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful plots.  
5. **Insights Summary** – Identify the most influential factors affecting survival.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization

## Insights
- **Gender and Class** were major determinants of survival.  
- **Younger passengers** had slightly higher chances of survival.  
- **Embarkation point and fare** showed subtle but notable effects on outcomes.
